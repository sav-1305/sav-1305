I'm Satvik Agrawal, a final-year Computer and Communications Undergraduate student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, with a strong interest in  in Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, and Systems Design. Currently engaged in optimising Machine Learning for IoT and network security applications. Exploring safety-critical system design in rocket avionics. Eager to deepen my expertise in applying information security principles to software and real-world engineering challenges.

Alongside my journey in Computer Science Engineering, I am exploring the field of High-Power Rocketry as the Team Leader of India's top rocketry team, ThrustMIT. Here, I lead a team of 37 engineers to design and launch a Sounding Rocket targeting an apogee of 30,000 feet. I also develop firmware solutions for the flight computer and associated testing systems. It is an engaging avenue for gaining practical experience in developing hardware systems, and firmware deployment and maintainence.
